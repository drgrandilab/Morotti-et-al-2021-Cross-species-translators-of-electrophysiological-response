Morotti et al. Cross-species translators of cardiac myocyte electrophysiology


This package contains the Matalb codes developed for building, analyzing, and
applying cross-species translators of cardiac myocyte electrophysiology as 
described in our manuscript.

The codes of the updated (baseline) models of mouse, rabbit, and human ventricular
myocytes can be found in the respective folders. They all share the same structure
that integrates descriptions of AP dynamics, Ca and Na handling, Ca/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase A signaling pathways.

The folder "Sensitivity Analysis" contains the codes required to build populations
of mouse, rabbit, and human models and perform parameter sensitivity analysis
(as shown in Fig. 1 in our manuscript).

The folder "Translators" contains the codes used to build, analyze, and apply the
translators to both simulated and experimental data (as shown in Figs. 3 to 9 in
our manuscript). To build the translators we applied the methodology originally
proposed by Gong & Sobie (NPJ Syst Biol Appl. 2018 Feb 24;4:11).

Each folder contains a "read me" file with more detailed instructions about how to
use our codes and recreate the figures shown in our manuscript.
